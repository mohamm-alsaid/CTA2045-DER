# CTA2045 module

This module aims at providing a translation from natural language to CTA2045. For example, it translates `shed` to its corresponding hex byte representation. It also provides the translation in the opposite direction (from hex bytes to natural language). The hope is to ease understanding & use of the CTA2045 standard.
