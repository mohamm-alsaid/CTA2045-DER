# DER agent simulator for CTA 2045
## what I need to do:
* add the following vars to the class:
* * intial battery SOC
* * ramp rate
* * constant current (linear)
* * constant voltage periods (linear)
* * time delay

phases:
1. pre-charge: current is kept low
2. starts when the EV has < 10% of SOC of (10%)
3.
